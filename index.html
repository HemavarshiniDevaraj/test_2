     While building a software application, the question arises where will you store your data and<br>
      how? The traditional approach is a simple text file or CSV file which is not a good choice in <br>
      today’s big data world. The solution is Database Management System(DBMS) which allows<br>
       different user application programs to concurrently access the same Database.<br>

A Database Management system(DBMS) is a simpler, easier, reliable, faster, secure, and<br>
 powerful software tool for Storing, Managing, and Retrieving data. There are two types of <br>
 Databases: Relational and Non-Relational Databases. An example of a Relational Database is<br>
  SQL Server and a Non-Relational Database is MongoDB. We will be discussing the key<br>
   differences between MongoDB vs SQL Server in this blog.<br>

<h2>What is MongoDB?</h2><br>
<img src="pic1.png" alt="pic1"><br>
MongoDB is a NoSQL Server in which data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) documents and<br>
 each document is essentially built on a key-value pair structure. As MongoDB easily stores<br>
  schemaless data, make it appropriate for capturing data whose structure is not known. This<br>
   document-oriented approach is designed to offer a richer experience with modern programming techniques.<br><br>

<h3>Features of MongoDB</h3><br>
<img src="pic2.png" alt="pic2"><br><br>
Main features of MongoDB which make it unique are:<br><br>
<h3>High Performance</h3><br><br>
Data operations on MongoDB are fast and easy because of their NoSQL nature. Data can be<br>
quickly stored, manipulated, and retrieved without any compromise on data integrity.<br><br>

<h3>Scalability</h3><br><br>
In the Big Data era, MongoDB data can be distributed across a cluster of machines quickly and<br>
 equally, free of bulkiness. The scalability of MongoDB handles a growing amount of data <br>
 capably. Sharding is a process in MongoDB used to horizontally scale the data across multiple <br>
 servers when the size of data increases.<br><br>
<h3>Availability</h3>
Data is highly available with MongoDB as it makes multiple copies of the same data and sends<br>
 copies of data across different servers. In case any server fails, data can be retrieved from <br>
 another server without delay.<br><br>
<h3>Flexibility</h3><br><br>
MongoDB can easily be combined with different Database Management Systems, both SQL and<br>
 NoSQL types. Document-oriented structure makes MongoDB schema dynamically flexible and <br>
 different types of data can be easily stored and manipulated.<br><br>

<h3>What is SQL Server?</h3><br><br>
<img src="pic3.png" alt="pic3">
SQL Server is a Relational Database Management System(RDBMS). It is also known as Microsoft<br>
 SQL Server or sometimes as MSSQL. SQL Server is developed by Microsoft and was initially<br>
  releases on April 24, 1989. Its stable release is SQL Server 2019 released on 4 November 2019.<br>
   MSSQL is written in programming languages like C and C++.<br><br>

SQL Server is based on the relational model introduced by E. F. Codd. In RDBMS data is stored <br>
in tables and the relationships among the data are maintained between tables. In tables, data is<br>
 organized in rows and columns format. Each column represents a particular field or feature and<br>
  each row in the table represents an entry or a record.<br><br>

Microsoft SQL Server offers a variety of editions with different functionally: Express, Enterprise,<br>
 Standard, Web, Developer. Express edition is freeware for small and entry-level applications <br>
while others are licensed-based editions used for bigger projects on commercial levels based<br> 
on the service required. SQL Server supports XML data type format and dynamic management<br>
 views.<br><br>

<h3>Features of SQL Server</h3><br><br>
<img src="pic4.png" alt="pic4">
<h3>Main features of SQL Server that make it highly usable are:</h3><br><br>

 <h3>Cloud Database Support</h3><br><br>
 Microsoft SQL Server offers editions that can be integrated with Microsoft cloud or Azure SQL<br>
  with built-in security and manageability. Cloud database support makes SQL Server highly<br>
  available, fast failover with minimum uptime.<br><br>
 
 <h3>Ease of Managemen</h3><br>
 Microsoft SQL Servers can easily be used with Windows and Linux systems. SQL Server<br>
  deployment and its management is easy with Kubernetes.<br><br>
 
 <h3>High Security</h3><br>
 Data in SQL Server is encrypted and highly secured. Schemas and Tables can be password<br>
   protected easily and can be accessed with permissions only.<br><br>
 
 <h3>End-to-End Business Data Solutions</h3><br>
 SQL Server mainly focuses on commercial needs so it provides end-to-end business data <br>
 solutions. Microsoft SQL Server offers tools for Data Administration,  ETL solutions, Online<br> 
 Analytical Processing(OLAP), and Data Mining purposes. It additionally provides Option <br>
 Reporting, Interactive Analysis, and Visual Data Exploration using SQL Server BI tools.<br><br>
